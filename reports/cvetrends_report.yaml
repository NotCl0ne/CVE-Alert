CVE-2019-19824:
- ''
- On certain TOTOLINK Realtek SDK based routers, an authenticated attacker may execute
  arbitrary OS commands via the sysCmd parameter to the boafrm/formSysCmd URI, even
  if the GUI (syscmd.htm) is not available. This allows for full control over the
  device's internals. This affects A3002RU through 2.0.0, A702R through 2.1.3, N301RT
  through 2.1.6, N302R through 3.4.0, N300RT through 3.4.0, N200RE through 4.0.0,
  N150RT through 3.4.0, and N100RE through 3.4.0.

- Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3,
  and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do
  not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An
  attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary
  code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From
  log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along
  with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.
  Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net,
  log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

CVE-2022-0778:
- ''
- 'The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug
  that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function
  is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed
  form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed
  form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that
  has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to
  verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally
  supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite
  loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit
  elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming
  server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers
  taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing
  certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic
  curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the
  attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the
  OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the
  certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However
  any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the
  infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger
  the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL
  versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2
  on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).'
