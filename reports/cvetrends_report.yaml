CVE-2019-19824:
- ''
- On certain TOTOLINK Realtek SDK based routers, an authenticated attacker may execute
  arbitrary OS commands via the sysCmd parameter to the boafrm/formSysCmd URI, even
  if the GUI (syscmd.htm) is not available. This allows for full control over the
  device's internals. This affects A3002RU through 2.0.0, A702R through 2.1.3, N301RT
  through 2.1.6, N302R through 3.4.0, N300RT through 3.4.0, N200RE through 4.0.0,
  N150RT through 3.4.0, and N100RE through 3.4.0.

- A security vulnerability has been discovered in the SAP Knowledge Warehouse - versions
  7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50. The usage of one SAP KW component within a Web browser enables
  unauthorized attackers to conduct XSS attacks, which might lead to disclose sensitive
  data.

CVE-2022-0778:
- ''
- 'The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug
  that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function
  is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed
  form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed
  form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that
  has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to
  verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally
  supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite
  loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit
  elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming
  server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers
  taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing
  certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic
  curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the
  attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the
  OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the
  certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However
  any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the
  infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger
  the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL
  versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2
  on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).'

- A flaw was found in CRI-O in the way it set kernel options for a pod. This issue
  allows anyone with rights to deploy a pod on a Kubernetes cluster that uses the
  CRI-O runtime to achieve a container escape and arbitrary code execution as root
  on the cluster node, where the malicious pod was deployed.

- A flaw was found in the way the "flags" member of the new pipe buffer structure
  was lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions
  in the Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user
  could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files
  and as such escalate their privileges on the system.
